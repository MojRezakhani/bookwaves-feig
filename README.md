# BookWaves Feig

A Java-based middleware for Feig Electronic RFID readers. It speaks to Feig hardware over TCP/IP
and exposes reader discovery, inventory, tag operations and live tag events over HTTP, so that it
can be used as a **middleware** for [BookWaves](https://github.com/lukaslerche/bookwaves). BookWaves
never talks to a reader directly — every RFID operation goes through a middleware like this one,
registered against a BookWaves installation with `type: http` (or the older `type: feig`).

## Documentation

Full documentation — deployment, reader configuration, supported tag formats, the complete HTTP API
and troubleshooting — lives at **https://docs.bookwaves.de**. This README covers only what's needed
to build and run this repository. Relevant starting points:

- [Supported readers and tag formats](https://docs.bookwaves.de/rfid-hardware/supported-readers-and-tag-formats/)
- [Configuring a Feig reader](https://docs.bookwaves.de/rfid-hardware/configuring-a-feig-reader/)
- [Host and notification operating modes](https://docs.bookwaves.de/rfid-hardware/host-and-notification-operating-modes/)
- [BookWaves Feig configuration reference](https://docs.bookwaves.de/deploy/bookwaves-feig-configuration-reference/)
- [BookWaves Feig HTTP reference](https://docs.bookwaves.de/extend/feig-http-reference/)
- [Production deployment](https://docs.bookwaves.de/deploy/production-deployment/) (container
  networking with BookWaves, reverse proxy and TLS, secrets)
- [Troubleshooting](https://docs.bookwaves.de/operate/troubleshooting/)

### Repository-specific additions

Local documentation covers features added after the documentation-site migration:

- [Tag formats, including ISO/TS 28560-4 identity and user memory](docs/tags.md)
- [Software-defined RSSI filtering](docs/adr/0002-filter-signal-strength-in-this-service.md)
  (`rssiFilterMode: software` is the default; managed readers must synchronise successfully
  before use, including after reconnecting)
- [Domain context](CONTEXT.md) and [architecture decisions](docs/adr/)

## Quick Start (Docker)

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your reader details and passwords — see the configuration reference above.
```

**Never commit `config.yaml` to version control** — it contains sensitive passwords. The service
also validates configured passwords on startup and logs a warning for any left at a placeholder
value.

Run the pre-built image:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 7070:7070 \
  -p 20001-20020:20001-20020 \
  -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/app/config/config.yaml:ro \
  ghcr.io/lukaslerche/bookwaves-feig:latest
```

Or with the provided `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The service is then available at `http://localhost:7070`. For reader configuration, operating
modes and the full configuration and HTTP references, see [Documentation](#documentation) above.

## Requirements

- Java 21 or newer (64-bit platforms only)
- Maven
- Feig SDK files — proprietary; see [FEIG SDK Setup](#feig-sdk-setup) below
- OpenSSL 3.2+ on Linux, for the SDK's TLS features
- Feig RFID readers with a TCP/IP network interface

The pre-built Docker image bundles the native dependencies above; these requirements apply when
building or running the service from source.

## FEIG SDK Setup

Before running the application from source, you must obtain the Feig SDK files.

1. **Download the Feig SDK** from the official Feig Electronic website:
   - Navigate to the SDK download section for Java
   - Download the latest Java SDK package (64-bit Linux version required)
   - Note: Current version used is: `FEIG.ID.SDK.Gen3.Java-v7.1.0`

2. **Extract required files** to the project directories:

   **JAR files** (`libs/` directory):
   ```
   libs/fedm-funit-java-api-1.1.0.jar
   libs/fedm-java-api-7.1.0.jar
   libs/fedm-service-java-api-11.2.1.jar
   ```

   **Native libraries** (`native/linux.x64/` directory):
   ```
   native/linux.x64/install.sh
   native/linux.x64/libfecom.so.5.1.0
   native/linux.x64/libfedm-funit.so.1.1.0
   native/linux.x64/libfedm-funit4j.so.1.1.0
   native/linux.x64/libfedm-service.so.11.2.1
   native/linux.x64/libfedm-service4j.so.11.2.1
   native/linux.x64/libfedm.so.7.1.0
   native/linux.x64/libfedm4j.so.7.1.0
   native/linux.x64/libfeisp.so.1.5.1
   native/linux.x64/libfetls.so.0.9.0
   native/linux.x64/libfeudp.so.1.0.0
   native/linux.x64/libfeusb2.so.1.1.0
   ```

3. **Create symbolic links** by running the provided install script:

   ```bash
   cd native/linux.x64
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

   This creates the required `.so` and `.so.X` symbolic links pointing to the versioned files.

4. **Verify directory structure** after running install.sh:

   ```
   .
   ├── libs/
   │   ├── fedm-funit-java-api-1.1.0.jar
   │   ├── fedm-java-api-7.1.0.jar
   │   └── fedm-service-java-api-11.2.1.jar
   ├── native/
   │   └── linux.x64/
   │       ├── install.sh
   │       ├── libfecom.so -> libfecom.so.5
   │       ├── libfecom.so.5 -> libfecom.so.5.1.0
   │       ├── libfecom.so.5.1.0
   │       ├── libfedm.so -> libfedm.so.7
   │       ├── libfedm.so.7 -> libfedm.so.7.1.0
   │       ├── libfedm.so.7.1.0
   │       └── (etc. - all libraries with symlinks)
   └── ...
   ```

**Note:** These files are proprietary and cannot be included in the repository. You must obtain
them directly from Feig Electronic.

**Troubleshooting native library setup:** if the application fails to start with an error related
to loading a native library, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` isn't pointing at `native/linux.x64` (Linux) or the
symlinks from step 3 above are missing. Check the startup logs for `java.library.path` to see what
Java is actually searching.

## Development

The following sections are for developers who want to build, modify, or contribute to the project.

### Local Configuration

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your reader settings
```

### Running the Application

Use the provided helper script:

```bash
./run.sh
```

The script automatically:

- Compiles the project
- Copies Maven runtime dependencies into `target/dependency`
- Sets the required runtime environment variables
- Starts `de.bookwaves.Main`

### Manual Execution (Optional)

For debugging or custom workflows, you can also run the application manually:

```bash
mvn compile dependency:copy-dependencies

export CONFIG_FILE_PATH=$(pwd)/config.yaml
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/native/linux.x64

java -cp "target/classes:target/dependency/*:libs/*" de.bookwaves.Main
```

You can also use the provided VS Code launch configuration.

### Running the tests

```bash
mvn test                # unit tests; no reader needed
mvn test -Phardware     # against the readers in config.hardware.yaml
```

`config.hardware.yaml` is gitignored and has the same shape as `config.yaml`. Copy
`config.example.yaml` to it and point it at the readers to test. Without that file, or
when a reader does not answer, or when the SDK's native library is missing, the
hardware tests are skipped with a reason rather than failed — so `-Phardware` is safe to
run anywhere.

The hardware run **writes to the readers**. It brings each one into agreement with
`config.hardware.yaml`, then mutates one RSSI filter to prove drift is detected and only
that parameter is repaired. Every write is permanent — no tested reader has a RAM-only
configuration bank — so a run that crashes midway leaves the reader changed. The
mutation prints the value it displaces before writing it, so it can be put back by hand
from the output. Point `config.hardware.yaml` at test readers, not at a live gate.

### Probing a reader

`probe.sh` reports which configuration parameters a physical reader actually supports, so
the synchronisation profiles can be checked against hardware rather than against the SDK's
parameter names. It reads the reader named in `config.yaml` and is read-only unless told
otherwise:

```bash
./probe.sh gate-in > probe-gate-in.txt 2>&1        # read-only
./probe.sh gate-in --write                          # also step one RSSI filter and put it back
./probe.sh gate-in --write --leave-written          # step it and leave the change in place
./probe.sh gate-in --set <parameter>=<value>        # write one numeric parameter exactly
```

Every write is permanent, as above.

### Developing with Devcontainer

The devcontainer provides a preconfigured Java and Maven development environment.

#### Usage

1. **Open in VS Code** with the Dev Containers extension installed

2. **Reopen in Container** - VS Code will prompt to reopen in the devcontainer, or use:
   - Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
   - Select: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

3. **Ensure the FEIG SDK files are available** as described in the FEIG SDK Setup section above.

4. **Create your configuration** if you have not already:

   ```bash
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   # Edit config.yaml with your reader settings
   ```

5. **Run the application**:

   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

   You can also use the provided VS Code launch configuration.

### Building the Docker Image

#### Prerequisites

The same SDK files are required for Docker builds:

1. **Ensure SDK files are in place** as described in [FEIG SDK Setup](#feig-sdk-setup) above
   - `libs/` - JAR files
   - `native/linux.x64/` - Native library files with symlinks

2. **Install Docker** with buildx support (included in Docker Desktop)

3. **Authenticate with GitHub Container Registry** (for pushing images):
   ```bash
   echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u USERNAME --password-stdin
   ```

   Or create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `write:packages` scope.

#### Build for Local Testing

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 --tag ghcr.io/lukaslerche/bookwaves-feig:latest --load .
```

**Note:** The `--platform linux/amd64` flag is required because the native libraries are platform-specific. The `--load` flag imports the image into your local Docker daemon for testing.

#### Push to GitHub Container Registry

1. **Build and push** with version tags:
   ```bash
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 \
     --tag ghcr.io/lukaslerche/bookwaves-feig:latest \
     --tag ghcr.io/lukaslerche/bookwaves-feig:1.7.1 \
     --push .
   ```

2. **Verify the push** by checking the GitHub Container Registry:
   - Navigate to your GitHub profile → Packages
   - Find `bookwaves-feig` package

3. **Make the package public** (optional):
   - Go to package settings
   - Change visibility to public

**Note:** Currently only `linux/amd64` is supported because the native libraries are x64-specific. Additional platforms would require corresponding native libraries from Feig.

### Environment Variables

- `CONFIG_FILE_PATH` - Path to configuration file (optional in Docker, defaults to `/app/config/config.yaml`)
- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` - Path to native libraries (set automatically in Dockerfile)

### Code architecture

A brief map of the main classes, for orientation when reading the source (this is not covered by
the documentation site, which documents behaviour rather than internal code structure):

- **ReaderManager** - Central registry for all readers
- **ManagedReader** - Wraps ReaderModule with mode-specific operations
- **TagFactory** - Auto-detects and creates appropriate Tag instances
- **ConfigLoader** - YAML configuration parser
